# Find & Jump üîçü¶ò (VS Code extension)

Easy way to find text, jump to it and cycle through matches, directly in your active editor window.

## Features

1. Press a keybinding to activate search mode
2. Enter your search text
3. Every new character will show new matches
4. Press another key (e.g. TAB) to cycle through the matches

The difference to other extensions like this is that every keystroke will show you new matches, without the need to confirm your search first.
